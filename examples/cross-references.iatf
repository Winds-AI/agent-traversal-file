{#intro}
@summary: Getting started with the API
# Introduction

Welcome to our API documentation! This tutorial will guide you through the basics.

Before starting, make sure you understand the {@fundamentals} of HTTP requests. If you run into authentication issues, see {@troubleshooting-auth}.

This guide covers:
1. Basic setup
2. Making your first request
3. Handling errors

**Next**: Read {@quickstart} to make your first API call.
{/intro}

{#fundamentals}
@summary: Basic concepts and terminology
# Fundamentals

This section covers the basic HTTP concepts you need to know:

- **REST**: Representational State Transfer
- **Endpoints**: API URLs that accept requests
- **Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations
- **Status Codes**: HTTP response codes indicating success or failure

For practical examples, see {@quickstart}.
{/fundamentals}

{#quickstart}
@summary: Your first API request in 5 minutes
# Quick Start

Make your first API call in under 5 minutes!

**Prerequisites**: Read {@fundamentals} first if you're new to REST APIs.

Step 1: Get an API key from your dashboard
Step 2: Use cURL to make a request:
```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.example.com/v1/users
```

Step 3: Parse the JSON response

Inline reference example: `{@troubleshooting-auth}` should still be detected.

**Common issues**: See {@troubleshooting-auth} if you get authentication errors.

**Next steps**: Learn about {@error-handling} to properly handle responses.
{/quickstart}

{#error-handling}
@summary: Understanding error responses and status codes
# Error Handling

APIs return different status codes and error messages.

Common status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `401`: Unauthorized (authentication error)
- `404`: Not found
- `429`: Rate limited

**Authentication errors?** See {@troubleshooting-auth}.

**Rate limit issues?** Check {@rate-limiting}.

Each error response includes:
- Error code
- Human-readable message
- Timestamp

Always check these fields before retrying.
{/error-handling}

{#rate-limiting}
@summary: Understanding API rate limits
# Rate Limiting

All API requests are rate-limited to ensure fair usage.

Limits:
- Free tier: 100 requests/hour
- Pro tier: 10,000 requests/hour
- Enterprise: Custom limits

**Headers**:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per hour
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when limit resets

When you hit the limit, you'll receive a `429` status code (see {@error-handling}).

Recommendation: Implement exponential backoff and monitor the rate limit headers.
{/rate-limiting}

{#troubleshooting-auth}
@summary: Common authentication issues and solutions
# Troubleshooting Authentication

Getting authentication errors? Here are the most common causes:

**Problem: 401 Unauthorized**
- Missing `Authorization` header
- Invalid or expired API key
- Malformed header format

See {@error-handling} for status code details.

**Solution**:
1. Verify your API key is active
2. Check the header format: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY`
3. Ensure you're using the correct key (not a token from another app)

**Still stuck?** Contact support with:
- Your API key (last 4 digits only)
- Timestamp of the failed request
- Request headers (without your full key)

**Related**: Check {@quickstart} for a working example request.
