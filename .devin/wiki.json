It solves the token efficiency problem that AI agents face when working with large files by providing self-indexing capabilities with 80-95% token savings. The system includes CLI tools in Go and Python for building and managing IATF files, with support for section references, watch mode for auto-rebuilding, and comprehensive validation. The repository contains dual implementations in Go and Python, installers for Windows/macOS/Linux, examples, and extensive documentation.",
