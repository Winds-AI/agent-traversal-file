{#questions}
@summary: Clarification questions about newsletter, sharing, payment, and system functionality
# Questions
1. In the case of "Leaving Popup", whenever the user clicks on any link that is not part of the customer website then a popup will be shown with an email address input field. So it will be kind of a "NewsLetter" of offers and adventure ideas? If yes, then where will this be managed from? {@home-page}

2. Adventure Listing Search: There is also the idea of providing additional information and images by hovering over the adventure card. -> Better to keep the details of the adventure on the detail page instead of showing content by hovering as it would be better for both web as well as mobile applications. {@listing-searching}

3. For Share to Social Media, even though Meta owns all three Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, they don't allow direct post sharing to Instagram, hence there is a chance that we might have to integrate their APIs and create a page for sharing the post. Then the post will reflect on the user's Instagram account. {@adventure-details}

4. In case of partial payment or just paying the booking fees, it says that the "rest of the payment will be provided to the vendor at the time of activity". So, that will be happening outside of our system, right? {@payments-booking-confirmation}

5. Can you explain a bit about your understanding of the "No question asked return add-on" which is under the cancellation policy? {@booking-cancellation-modifications}

6. As per one of your images, there was a blue note in the image saying that once there is a change in user access from Role Management, then all the admin users who are logged in are to be logged out to make sure their new session starts with updated rights(access). This can have a couple of drawbacks, so what about providing updated access to each user in the admin panel whenever any page refreshes? {@role-management-module-access}

7. It says in the document that there will be an expiration date for the Bandar credits. How is this possible? Credits are points and they are not like coupons or offers, usually, applications and such don't have any expiration for any kind of currency(points) they provide to their users. {@bandar-credits-management}

8. In the "Adventure Activity Listings" in Admin Portal it was mentioned that the "Admin can validate a section of activities by checkboxes", but then it also says "For each section, there will be a field to approve or reject it". So which will it be? Checkboxes or an approve/decline button or a field? {@adventure-activity-listings-management}

9. Continuing on the above question, it also says "Finally, there will be a checkbox ability for the entire activity which will (make it go live)". So instead of a checkbox, a button would be better, so clicking the button would validate each field and if any is remaining then it won't go live, but along with each field validation, there will be a button to approve all fields at once, which will then make it go live too. {@adventure-activity-listings-management}

10. In the case of "Tags", it was said that "The Tags as explained earlier will have the name, thumbnail, and brief description", but in all explanations, there is no thumbnail or description of the Tag. It is just like the normal tags they have on "Instagram". So, will there still be a thumbnail, or will it just be a tag like: "Kids friendly", "Adult only", "Thrilling" or "Awesome"? {@activity-tags-management}

11. In case of badge and certificate assigning, how will the Admin Panel know to assign the badge or certificate to a specific user? For example Badge has to be assigned in case of completing an activity, then how will the Admin Panel know whether this specific person completed that activity or not? Cause there is nothing from the vendor's end that provides details to the Admin Panel that this person did this. {@certificates-badges-management}

12. In the case of "Blogs", it was said that the blogs would be managed by creating them in an offline Word document, and later the Admin Panel would have to upload that blog without making any changes, but instead of this, it's far better to go with a text editor provided to you. In that, blogs could be created and that can be then sent to the customer website to show as blogs. {@blogs-management}

13. Why are there rights for the Admin to create slots in the Update Inventory? Cause slots would be managed by the Vendor, and wouldn't the Vendor only manage them? {@inventory-management}

14. Will there be custom Tags? Or will the Vendor only be able to add Tags from a list created by the Admin? {@activity-tags-management}

15. In the user screen(admin), will there be a Role Management screen needed or a module screen? {@role-management-module-access}

16. In Milestone 2 of the customer web portal, what is the acknowledgment for, is it for payments acknowledgment or booking acknowledgment {@payments-booking-confirmation}

17. In the cancellation of booking from the vendor side, payment will be done with the original payment mode (Ex. if we paid 200 rupees at the time of booking we use 15 banana credits and rest payment will be done by UPI/Credit card/Debit Card etc.. Now at the time of return we need to return all 200 rupees into UPI/Credit card/Debit Card or else do it with original mode. {@booking-cancellation-modifications}
